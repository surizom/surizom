## Hello ! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Moaad, and I am a full stack web developer : frontend, backend and operations.

Passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems.

Very curious, I like trying out new technologies and techniques.

I believe that agile and XP principles and practices are the best way to deliver high-quality, cost-effective and long-lasting software.

Currently trying to improve my knowledge and skills in Domain-Driven Design.

I also take pretty pictures of the night sky whenever I can ! :)
