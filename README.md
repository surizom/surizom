## Hello !

I'm Moaad, and I do full stack web development and devops.

I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems.

Very curious, I like trying out new technologies and techniques.

I am a strong believer in having a Kaizen approach in work and in life.

I also believe that agile and XP principles and practices are the best way to deliver high-quality, cost-effective and long-lasting software.

I also do astrophotgraphy whenever I can ! :)
